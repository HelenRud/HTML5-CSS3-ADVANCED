        <h2>incredible stories about food</h2>
        <h3>Ice-cream</h3>
        <img src="img\ice-cream.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In the 400th century BC, in the Persian Empire, they tried to do something like ice cream, mixing snow and grape juice. Then a very original dish was invented: ice and saffron were mixed with various fruits. The Arabs were the first to prepare milk-based ice cream, and already in the 10th century it was possible to try this delicacy in major cities - Baghdad, Damascus and Cairo.</p>
       
        <h3>Eggs</h3>
        <img src="img\eggs.jpg" alt="">
        <p>We all know from childhood that an egg consists of protein and yolk, but not many people know that it contains 12 vitamins and a number of useful minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, iodine, copper, iron and cobalt. Contrary to popular belief, the amount of cholesterol and fat that make up this product is not large. Chickens of different breeds lay eggs of different color, but it does not affect the nutritional characteristics. In Russia and the United States, mainly white or light beige eggs are sold, and in England light brown ones are more common.</p>
